## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Web Application**: Pure client-side application
- **Firebase Hosting**: Can be deployed to Firebase hosting
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports environment variables for different deployments

### Recommended Deployment
1. **Development**: Local server with Firebase emulators
2. **Staging**: Firebase hosting with staging Firebase project
3. **Production**: Firebase hosting with production Firebase project
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific Firebase configurations

### Security Considerations
- Admin access controlled via authentication
- Firestore security rules configured for survey platform
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Client-side validation with server-side rule enforcement

## Firebase Setup

### Firestore Security Rules
The app includes two sets of security rules:

1. **Production Rules** (`firestore.rules`):
   - Public read access to surveys
   - Authenticated write access for surveys
   - Public write access for responses (survey submissions)
   - Authenticated read access for responses (admin dashboard)

2. **Development Rules** (`firestore-dev.rules`):
   - Open read/write access for testing
   - Use only during development

### Applying Security Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules
2. Copy the content from `firestore.rules` (for production) or `firestore-dev.rules` (for testing)
3. Paste into the rules editor and publish

### Demo Mode
The app automatically falls back to demo mode when Firebase permissions are limited, showing sample survey data for testing the interface.

### Scalability Notes
- Firebase handles backend scaling automatically
- Client-side rendering may need optimization for large surveys
- Analytics aggregation may require server-side functions for large datasets
- Consider Firebase Functions for complex business logic as the platform grows
