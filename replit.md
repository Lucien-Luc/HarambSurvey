## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Component-based Structure**: Modular JavaScript classes for different functionality areas
- **Responsive Design**: CSS-based responsive layout using CSS variables and modern styling
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic functionality

### Backend Architecture
- **Firebase as Backend-as-a-Service**: Uses Firebase for all backend operations
- **Real-time Database**: Firestore for storing surveys, responses, and user data
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth for admin user management
- **Serverless**: No custom backend server required

### Key Technologies
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Firebase (Firestore, Auth)
- Chart.js for analytics visualization
- XLSX.js for data export functionality
- Font Awesome for icons

## Key Components

### 1. Survey Interface (`js/survey.js`)
- **Purpose**: Handles the public-facing survey taking experience
- **Features**: Multi-step surveys, response validation, skip logic
- **Key Methods**: Question navigation, response tracking, form submission

### 2. Form Builder (`js/form-builder.js`)
- **Purpose**: Admin interface for creating and editing surveys
- **Features**: Drag-and-drop question builder, real-time preview, question type management
- **Architecture**: Component-based question types with configurable properties

### 3. Admin Dashboard (`js/admin.js`)
- **Purpose**: Administrative interface for survey management
- **Features**: Survey CRUD operations, bulk actions, user management
- **Access Control**: Long-press authentication on logo for admin access

### 4. Analytics Engine (`js/analytics.js`)
- **Purpose**: Data visualization and reporting
- **Features**: Chart generation, export functionality, real-time analytics
- **Charts**: Uses Chart.js for various visualization types

### 5. Firebase Integration (`js/firebase-config.js`)
- **Purpose**: Backend service configuration and management
- **Features**: Environment-based configuration, authentication state management
- **Security**: Environment variable support for sensitive configuration

### 6. Utility Library (`js/utils.js`)
- **Purpose**: Shared functionality across components
- **Features**: Device detection, date formatting, data validation helpers

## Data Flow

### Survey Creation Flow
1. Admin authenticates via long-press mechanism
2. Form builder interface loads with drag-and-drop components
3. Survey configuration saved to Firestore in real-time
4. Survey published and made available via unique URL

### Survey Response Flow
1. User accesses survey via public URL
2. Survey data loaded from Firestore
3. Responses collected and validated in real-time
4. Final submission stored in Firestore with metadata
5. Analytics updated automatically

### Admin Analytics Flow
1. Real-time listeners update analytics dashboard
2. Chart.js renders visualizations from response data
3. Export functionality generates downloadable reports
4. Filtering and search capabilities for data exploration

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Firebase SDK**: Authentication, Firestore database, hosting
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization and analytics charts
- **XLSX.js**: Excel file generation for data exports
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for UI elements

### CDN Resources
- Firebase SDK loaded via CDN for performance
- Chart.js and XLSX.js loaded externally
- Font Awesome icons loaded from CDN

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Setup
- **Static Web Application**: Pure client-side application
- **Firebase Hosting**: Can be deployed to Firebase hosting
- **Environment Configuration**: Supports environment variables for different deployments

### Recommended Deployment
1. **Development**: Local server with Firebase emulators
2. **Staging**: Firebase hosting with staging Firebase project
3. **Production**: Firebase hosting with production Firebase project
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific Firebase configurations

### Security Considerations
- Admin access controlled via authentication
- Firestore security rules configured for survey platform
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration data
- Client-side validation with server-side rule enforcement

## Firebase Setup

### Firestore Security Rules
The app includes two sets of security rules:

1. **Production Rules** (`firestore.rules`):
   - Public read access to surveys
   - Authenticated write access for surveys
   - Public write access for responses (survey submissions)
   - Authenticated read access for responses (admin dashboard)

2. **Development Rules** (`firestore-dev.rules`):
   - Open read/write access for testing
   - Use only during development

### Applying Security Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules
2. Copy the content from `firestore.rules` (for production) or `firestore-dev.rules` (for testing)
3. Paste into the rules editor and publish

### Demo Mode
The app automatically falls back to demo mode when Firebase permissions are limited, showing sample survey data for testing the interface.

### Scalability Notes
- Firebase handles backend scaling automatically
- Client-side rendering may need optimization for large surveys
- Analytics aggregation may require server-side functions for large datasets
- Consider Firebase Functions for complex business logic as the platform grows
