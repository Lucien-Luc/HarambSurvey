# Security Configuration Notice

## Admin Access Security

Your BPN Survey Platform has been configured with enhanced security measures to prevent unauthorized admin access:

### Security Features Implemented:

1. **Email Whitelist**: Only `admin@bpn.com` is authorized to access admin functions
2. **Client-Side Validation**: Email addresses are verified before authentication attempts
3. **Server-Side Validation**: Firestore security rules enforce admin email restrictions
4. **Double Authentication Check**: Both client and server verify admin credentials

### Firebase Security Rules Applied:

The following collections are now restricted to authorized admin emails only:
- **surveys**: Only admins can create/update surveys
- **responses**: Only admins can read/update/delete responses  
- **users**: Only admins can access user data
- **settings**: Only admins can modify settings
- **analytics**: Only admins can access analytics

### Public Access Maintained:

- **Survey Taking**: Anyone can still take surveys (responses collection allows public create)
- **Survey Reading**: Anyone can read published surveys for public access

### To Apply These Security Rules:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `tasked-7bfac` 
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules**
4. Copy the content from `firestore.rules` file
5. Paste into the rules editor and click **"Publish"**

### Important Notes:

- **No New Admin Creation**: The system will not allow creating new admin accounts
- **Existing Admin Only**: Only the pre-configured admin@bpn.com account can access admin functions
- **Survey Responses**: Public users can still submit survey responses as intended
- **Demo Mode**: Falls back to demo mode if Firebase access is restricted

This ensures your survey platform remains secure while maintaining full public survey functionality.
