# Firebase Setup Instructions

## Current Issue
Your app is showing Firebase permission errors even though you've set up the rules. This typically happens when:

1. **Firestore database not created** - The database needs to be initialized first
2. **Rules not properly deployed** - Rules may not have been published correctly

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Enable Firestore Database
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `tasked-7bfac`
3. Click **"Firestore Database"** in the left menu
4. If you see "Create database", click it and:
   - Choose "Start in test mode" (for now)
   - Select a location (like `us-central1`)
   - Click "Done"

### 2. Apply Security Rules
Once the database is created:
1. Go to **"Firestore Database" → "Rules"**
2. Replace the existing rules with this content:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

3. Click **"Publish"**

### 3. Test the Connection
1. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/test-firebase.html`
2. Click "Test Firebase" button
3. If successful, click "Add Sample Survey"
4. Go back to `http://localhost:5000` to see your survey

### 4. Current App Status
- ✅ Firebase configuration is correct
- ✅ Your project credentials are working
- ❌ Database permissions need to be fixed
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design is complete
- ✅ Demo mode works as fallback
