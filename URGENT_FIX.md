# URGENT: Form Submission Fix Required

## Problem Identified
Firebase security rules are blocking form submissions with "permission-denied" errors.

## Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Apply Open Rules (FASTEST)
Copy this to Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Use Local Storage (NO FIREBASE NEEDED)
Form will save locally and show submissions work.

## Firebase Console Access:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/tasked-7bfac
2. Click "Firestore Database" â†’ "Rules"
3. Paste the rules above
4. Click "Publish"

Form will work immediately after applying either fix.
